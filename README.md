## X Clone

I have already made multiple reddit clones and nobody in their right mind uses Facebook anymore but I thought the best thing to clone would be twitter, or X as the younguns call these days.

## Features

- Authentication, email and password for now.
- Ability to create threads
- Opening threads to see details
- Commenting on them also makes another thread

I honestly have no idea how twitter works, so I might have to explore it a bit and implement the core features so I don't use it much but for now we are going to have just text threads and no images, later maybe I will add the ability to add images.

PS: I will not use Nodejs for it anymore, I am bored out of my mind for that so I will use Go and Gin.
